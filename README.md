## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, I build a convolutional neural network based on the [German Traffic Sign Database Benchmark (GTSDB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/) dataset and use it to predict German road signs not present in the set. The goals/steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set).
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set.
* Design, train and test a model architecture.
* Use the model to make predictions on new images.
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images.
* Summarize the results with a written report.

For more information, please see the following files in this repo:
* [Writeup report](https://github.com/ragou19/Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/writeup.md) with more explanation of the project.
* [IPython notebook](https://github.com/ragou19/Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb). To run this or make edits, see below.
* [HTML version](https://github.com/ragou19/Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html) of the IPython notebook.

### Dependencies
Running the IPython notebook on your own machine requires the following:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The necessary lab environment can be created with the CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

### Dataset and Repository

1. Download the data set. Udacity students have a link to the data set in their course content. To run your own images, please see the [German Traffic Sign Database Benchmark (GTSDB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/) webpage.
2. Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ragou19/Traffic-Sign-Classifier
jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
```
